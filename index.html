  <p>Spiral Jetta is a journey through the land art of the American West focused
     on the author’s road trip narrative. Erin Hogan attempts to find solitude
     despite her Chicago “urban sensibility” in hopes to learnt to enjoy being
     alone. She sets off in her city driving Volkswagen Jetta from Chicago to
     the Salt Lake City onward her first destination, the Spiral Jetty. Hence
     the book title, Spiral Jetta. One does not necessarily need to be an art
     history aficionado to enjoy the book. Hogan’s beautiful experiences of
     heightened perception with land art appeals to a broad audience. It is
     touching on the human experience and quiet moments we aim to strive for:
     stimulation, wonder, awakening, and joy.</p>
  <div id="spiral jetty">
    <p>Hogan’s first destination: Robert Smithson’s <em>Spiral Jetty</em> in Utah. It was
      interesting how she describes the stark whiteness or layers of salt defining
      the sense of time which Smithson refers to as his “crystalline structure of
      time” (27). It was interesting how she approaches getting acquainted with
      the Jetty, getting close as to taste the salt. Further contemplating, she
      finds Jetty rejecting and agreeing with Fried’s theory of “objectness.” That
      it might be both art and object. This work is all about erosion and change
      over time. It forces one to be in the present, to see the Jetty at its
      current state of erosion.</div> On her next stop was Nancy Holt’s <em>Sun Tunnels</em>, 4
      tubes that perfectly frame the sun depending on the time of year. A very
      site-specific work but useless in her opinion. Being unable to find it, she
      goes to Arches National Park in Moab. Barely knowing how to pitch a tent,
      she finds herself entertained by 19-year-olds and then explores Arches. She
      compares Arches to the Jetty, “Spiral Jetty has been shaped by addition, not
      subtraction… its effect is rather that of emergence, rising, growing” (75).
      The arches have aged, but the Jetty ages differently as an accumulation. At
      Heizer’s <em>Double Negative</em>, she finds herself enjoying nature a lot more than
      how she expected art to do all that for her satisfaction. After Arches, she
      gets to the Mormon Mesa and visits this tourist attraction called Hole n’
      the Rock. This quirky house filled with taxidermy inside a drilled rock
      dwelling. She finds it fascinating how this weird art endeavor naturally
      exists as someone’s true desires. That it is very genuine, yet very strange.
      She thinks what kind of a life this is, later comparing to Judd at the last
      part of the trip. She seems to be more convinced by this weird man’s house
      and desire to make what he wants to make, instead of Judd, who let her
      expectations down. Why wasn’t he as genuinely sterile in his environment?
      She wondered why Judd did not live as sterile as his cubes, a question of
      why the artist isn’t his art. I thought it to be humorous. From her
      experience in the <em>Lightning Field</em>, she discusses how interacting with the
      installations affect the experience. <div id="marfa">She analyzes this heavily of Judd’s
      work. Only harsh lighting was available, but it didn’t matter to her. The
      way the shadows land where, or your presence casting shadows and affecting
      the structures around you. Hogan said it did not need different light, like
      the lightning field didn’t need lightning to be enjoyed. Aesthetics of
      object permanence and high specificity mattered to Judd. I appreciate her
      linking Juarez to Marfa. Hogan steps out of her city, privileged outlook to
      experience uncomfortable places. She was able to touch on Marfa’s history
      with its old tensions between Mexican underprivileged population vs. art
      tourism and gentrification, tension between the people in the area and how
      it impacts the art.</div></p>
<div id="lightning field">
  <p>Lightning Field is a remarkable chapter. At this point, Hogan embraces being
     alone which makes her at ease while driving through New Mexico. This newfound
     confidence, I believe shifted her enjoyment of the journey to an elevated
     spirit. By sunset, Hogan embraces land art fully and finally finds what she
     was looking for at Walter De Maria’s Lightning Field. With lovely imagery,
     she poetically describes the way the sun set on the poles and how she felt.
     In her words, it felt like “a warm, internal tornado” (125). From the 24-hour
     mandatory stay, comes the observation: “Lightning Field in the evening was
     ablaze and defiant, in the morning it offered a soft and slow awakening”
     (128). After some analysis, Hogan compared the difference from this to Spiral
     Jetty, how De Maria’s intentions are to maintain the field in its original,
     gleaming state. Whereas, Smithson lets elements add to the Jetty. I think
     this redeemable part of trip turned her around from mostly admiring nature to
     admiring the art itself, where awakening happened. “This heightened sense of
     perception awakens in me whenever I think of that dawn in the Lightning
     Field” (129). After theory and discussion with peers, Hogan comes to a
     conclusion that all the works have something to do with the passage of time
     and the inexplorable movement of the earth and sun. The reoccurring quote,
     “The sum of the facts does not constitute the work or determines its
     aesthetics,” (134) proves one can’t fully fathom the Lightning Field, no
     amount of speculation can make one fully understand, however they can just
     choose to appreciate. The Lightning Field just works.</p>
</div>
<p>Since I have not much experience with land art, I learned a couple things
  from how Hogan approaches artwork. Copy the way she approaches it. Be in the
  artworks. Walk through it, see how different the experience is from which
  location you are in. Even taste the salt of the Jetty. <div id="double negative">Be in the Double
  Negative. Think about the relationship of the piece to time and space.
  Analyze how you feel. Does it feel right to be part of it? Or do you feel that
  human experience should be outside of it, not to contaminate the art.</div> Spend as
  much time as you can with the work, just as she felt with the Jetty. Maybe
  think of how the work connects to art history. Does it touch on minimalism,
  abstract expressionism? I like how she relates painters to sculptors. There
  are relationships to be connected when analyzing art. But sometimes, the work
  does not need an educational point of view. That it should be viewed on its
  own, as Greenberg modernist as that sounds. I appreciate Hogan’s honesty of
  loneliness, anxiety, and disorientation. Right from the start, she knew her
  weaknesses. I think what everyone can take away from her journey is that we
  need interactions. Whether at the destination or the in-betweens. What we do
  not know, other people do. And how people interpret, and experience art is
  different from ours. While she chose to travel to Spiral Jetty alone, she
  found people who were looking for the same thing, Heather and Bill. The lesson
  is that we are not so alone as we think. That this search for an experience is
  what we share with other people. Outside of art theory, I think this is a good
  read for anyone looking for that experience. It is for both art lovers and
  anybody curious.</p>
